    "\n",
    "* Range of incubation periods for the disease in humans (and how this varies across age and health status) and how long individuals are contagious, even after recovery.\n",
    "* Prevalence of asymptomatic shedding and transmission (e.g., particularly children).\n",
    "* Seasonality of transmission.\n",
    "* Physical science of the coronavirus (e.g., charge distribution, adhesion to hydrophilic/phobic surfaces, environmental survival to inform decontamination efforts for affected areas and provide information about viral shedding).\n",
    "* Persistence and stability on a multitude of substrates and sources (e.g., nasal discharge, sputum, urine, fecal matter, blood).\n",
    "* Persistence of virus on surfaces of different materials (e,g., copper, stainless steel, plastic).\n",
    "* Natural history of the virus and shedding of it from an infected person.\n",
    "* Implementation of diagnostics and products to improve clinical processes.\n",
    "* Disease models, including animal models for infection, disease and transmission.\n",
    "* Tools and studies to monitor phenotypic change and potential adaptation of the virus.\n",
    "* Immune response and immunity.\n",
    "* Effectiveness of movement control strategies to prevent secondary transmission in health care and community settings.\n",
    "* Effectiveness of personal protective equipment (PPE) and its usefulness to reduce risk of transmission in health care and community settings.\n",
    "* Role of the environment in transmission."
